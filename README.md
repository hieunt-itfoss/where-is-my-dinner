## Where is my dinner?

---

Hi Fossil-Cloud gangs!

> Have you ever forgotten to order your dinner? "Check this extension ü§ü" : "Just go"

This extension will remind you to do that. Some features haven't been implemented yet so feel free to make some PR.



**Features**

- Set reminder time whenever you want the notification pops out.

- Clear the existed alarms.

- Quick open Order Form (to confirm your choice or something else).
  
  

**Not fulfilled**

- Automation. Because currently, I cannot get REST API to send request to submit answer to Google Form. And Google restricts those acts.



**How to install**

- Navigate to¬†`chrome://extensions`
- Expand the Developer dropdown menu and click ‚ÄúLoad Unpacked Extension‚Äù
- Navigate to the local folder containing the extension‚Äôs code and click Ok



**Demo**
